  <li><autocolor><i>Introduction:</i> The fault information of operation system is typically recorded in system logs, while trace data captures various event information during the operation of the OS. To enhance the fault diagnosis capability for OS, I first design a multimodal representation learning model to extract fault features from log data and trace data. Based on this, I implement an anomaly detection application using an autoencoder, enabling efficient fault detection for OS.</autocolor></a></li>

  <li><autocolor><i>Introduction:</i> I participant in the research on graph construction for intrusion data and develop representation learning approach for them. Initially, I design a graph construction method that leverages both the local and global association within intrusion data. Following this, I design and implement an effective Graph Neural Network (GNN) model based on incidence matrix. This model facilitates the extraction of intrinsic features and enables representative representation learning. Finally, based on these approaches, I implement an effective intrusion detection method that can be applied to various intrusion datasets.</autocolor></a></li>
