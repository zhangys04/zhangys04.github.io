  <li><autocolor>Introduction: The fault information of operation system is typically recorded in system logs, while trace data captures various event information during the operation of the OS. To enhance the fault diagnosis capability for OS, I first design a multimodal representation learning model to extract fault features from log data and trace data. Based on this, I implement an anomaly detection application using an autoencoder, enabling efficient fault detection for OS.</autocolor></a></li>
